        android:text="This final part of the test involves 1) Creating a ListView with reusable list items,
2) Creating a Service to obtain data,
3) Hitting a simple JSON network service to provide the data and sending a broadcast when data is ready, and
4) Binding to the service to provide an API that will update the data. Try to approach this in steps.
Start by getting placeholder data to display in the ListView before moving on to the Service, and eventually
JSON parsing.  Also, for your list items, please provide a simple layout with at least 2 TextViews (the part3_listview_item.xml
is already in place for you to edit). Please refer
to the 'TODO' comments in source code for further guidance."
